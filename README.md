🔗 **Fully Offline, Fully Private P2P File Transfer & Device Control** - Breaking Barriers Between PC and Android Devices

## 💭 Project Origin

Stationuli was born from three core driving forces:

1. **Project Experience Accumulation** 📚: Through previous project development, I deeply explored file transfer technologies between different devices in offline environments, especially Android to PC scenarios, accumulating rich practical experience.

2. **Personal Real Needs** 🏠: As a developer, I urgently need a software solution to build a completely personal workstation, achieving device connectivity, complete privacy, offline-first, and autonomous control.

3. **Technical Exploration Spirit** 🔬: Stationuli is also a practical platform for researching different technology ecosystems, exploring Rust ecosystem, cross-platform development, P2P networking, system integration, and other cutting-edge technologies.
